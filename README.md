2. Open the terminal and navigate to this project's production directory called "ToDoList".
3. Within the production directory "ToDoList", create a new file called `appsettings.json`.

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=to_do_list_with_many_to_many;uid=root;pwd=epicodus;"
  }
}
```

5. Create the database using the migrations in the To Do List project. Open your shell to the production directory "ToDoList", and run `dotnet ef database update`. 
6. Within the production directory "ToDoList", run `dotnet watch run` in the command line to start the project in development mode with a watcher.
